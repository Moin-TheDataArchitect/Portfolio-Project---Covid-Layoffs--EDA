-- EDA

-- Here we are jsut going to explore the data and find trends or patterns or anything interesting like outliers

-- Normally when you start the EDA process you have some idea of what you're looking for

-- With this info we are just going to look around and see what we find!

Looking forward to taking my data analytics journey further with more advanced projects and real-world applications. Let's connect and discuss all things data-driven decision-making!

A special thanks to Alex Freberg for his fantastic content that helped me navigate through complex topics and apply them in a structured way.
